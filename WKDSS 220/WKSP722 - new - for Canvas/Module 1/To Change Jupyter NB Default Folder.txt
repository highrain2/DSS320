To change the default folder to the place you want, open the Anaconda command prompt and type the following (for Windows):
jupyter notebook --notebook-dir="Path of new folder"

Example
jupyter notebook --notebook-dir="C:\Users\hiren\Documents\WKSP 220\WKSP722 - new - for Canvas"

Then open Jupyter Notebook again from the command prompt and it should open to the folder you defined above.
